# CustomizedSpinner
I have customized the Spinner widget with core code and not used any third party library to make some simple changes. 
In this Spinner widget i have customized following things:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1) Dropdown list width<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2) Item of dropdown list by changing its color showing icon for selected item<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3) Changed the background of dropdown list with rounded shape and color.
